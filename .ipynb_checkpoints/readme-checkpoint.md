# Skin Disease Detection - CNN Based

## Structure

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Image loading, augmentation, and saving
- `cnn_model.py`: CNN architecture, compile, train, evaluate, save
- `main.ipynb`: Main pipeline and hyperparameter tuning

## Goal

Classify skin disease images using a modular and tunable CNN pipeline.

## Next Steps

- Improve architecture
- Grid Search for best hyperparameters
